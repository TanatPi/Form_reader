# Azure Document Intelligence Form to CSV
## Overview

This repository contains test scripts and sample data to evaluate if **Azure Document Intelligence (DI)** can accurately read and interpret forms containing check marks and put them into csv automatically.

The goal is to verify the capability of Azure DI's form recognizer to detect and extract checkbox values from scanned or digital forms.

## Tested contents

**sample-forms/**: Sample form images and PDFs with check marks

> **Note:** The actual form used in this project is proprietary and will **not** be shared publicly. The provided code and tests are optimized specifically for that formâ€™s structure and layout to see if it works without Azure DI finetuning.

## Setup

1. Create an Azure Form Recognizer resource and get the endpoint URL and API key.
2. Install dependencies (Python example):
   ```bash
   pip install azure-ai-formrecognizer
